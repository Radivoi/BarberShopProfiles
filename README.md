# BarberShopProfiles

BarberShop Profiles is an addon that adds support for appearance profiles to the in-game barbershop in order to make it easier to switch back and forth between different characters.

Profiles can be saved, loaded and deleted, and are stored per race on your account so you can access the same appearances on any other character of the same race.
